# The Sylar Project

Production Link ðŸ‘‰ https://the-sylar-project-6avzk.ondigitalocean.app/

## Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 8.0 or greater installed on your system.

## Setup

Get the code by either cloning this repository using git

```
git clone https://github.com/Rahat-ch/The_Sylar_Project
```

... or [downloading source code](https://github.com/Rahat-ch/The_Sylar_Project/archive/main.zip) code as a zip archive.

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then start the example app with:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:3000 ðŸš€

## Contributing

Create a branch with your work. Your branch should be named using your initials and the feature you worked on. For example if I added more mental health resources to the API I would name my branch like this:

```
rc/addApiResources
```

Open a pull request to the develop branch and once reviewed if no changes are needed your code will be merged in!

## Custom Sylar Project for your Local Community

If you would like to build a custom version of the Sylar Project for your country or community I encourage it! You can use the Deploy to Digital Ocean Button below and get a working deployment of this right away. Make a PR to this Readme with the link to your version so I can feature it here!
